		We are happy to bring out the first issue of the departmental magazine “COSCENGERS
INSPIRE” for the academic year 2019. The magazine that is a launch pad for the student’s
creativity and skills will definitely be embraced by the student community.In this issue the
faculty article is on ‘Graph Mining ‘by Dr. PVLS Jagadamba who has neatly introduced the
concept of Graph Mining to the readers. There are two student articles one on the evolution of
robotics and the other on convolution neural networks. The article has introduced the
concepts in the beautiful manner. This is followed by the regular sections of Technology
Review, Know a Scientist, Short Story and Puzzles, Arts. This issue also contains the
Contributions and Achievements of the students of the department during the previous
semester.We are thankful to the entire department for their continuous support in bringing
this issue successful.
